## Features

- **Multiple snakes** — up to 6 AI-controlled snakes roam the board simultaneously, each with its own food target and color.
- **Conway Walls** — optionally fill the board with structures generated by Conway's Game of Life, creating a maze that regenerates on a configurable interval and forces snakes to find new paths.
- **Satiety & wander mode** — after eating 10 pellets a snake enters a relaxed wander mode, slowly shedding tail segments before getting hungry again.
- **Emoji thought bubbles** — snakes express their mood (eating 😋, full 😌, scared 😰, greeting 👋, death 💥).
- **Day / Night themes** — toggle a dark palette at any time.
- **Fully customisable colors** — snake head, board background, and wall color are each independently configurable.
- **Adjustable speed** — 1–60 ticks per second.

## Usage

### Standalone (browser)

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. A settings gear (⚙) in the corner opens the in-page control panel.

### Lively Wallpaper

1. Add `index.html` as a new wallpaper source in [Lively Wallpaper](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively).
2. Use the bundled `LivelyProperties.json` to expose all settings in Lively's property panel (speed, colors, Conway mode, etc.).
